	<h3 style="margin-left:10%"> What is Microprocessor ?</h3> <br>
	<p style="margin-left:5%">
The microprocessor is the central unit of a computer system that performs arithmetic and logic operations,
which generally include adding, subtracting, transferring numbers from one area to another, and comparing two numbers.
It's often known simply as a processor, a central processing unit, or as a logic chip.
It's essentially the engine or the brain of the computer that goes into motion when the computer is switched on.</br> It's a programmable, multipurpose device that incorporates the functions of a CPU (central processing unit) on a single IC (integrated circuit).</p><br>

<h3 style="margin-left:10%">The 4 Main Functions of a CPU</h3><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">
   Once the instructions are fetched, the CPU “team” now has to make sense of them.<br> That’s where two components called the instruction decoder and instruction set architecture (ISA) come in.<br> The ISA determines how the instructions should be interpreted, and the instruction decoder translates them in a way that other members of the CPU “team” can understand.
   The first thing a CPU does is fetch instructions for a given task from the program memory. Going back to the team metaphor for a moment, imagine the program memory as a large library. The first member of the CPU team is an expert librarian who can instantly retrieve — or fetch — a set of instructions for any given task.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-left:10%">Different Types of CPUs<h3><br>

<p style="margin-left :5%">
   Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are the two most popular CPU producers on the market in terms of manufacturers. Intel produces desktop CPUs like Celeron, Pentium and Core, while AMD’s processors include Sempron, Athlon and Phenom.

  	<h1 style="margin-left:15%">Vacuum Tube</h1>
</fieldset>
<frameset>
  	<p id="p2">A vacuum tube consists of two or more electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight envelope.
  	 Most tubes have glass envelopes with a glass-to-metal seal based on kovar sealable borosilicate glasses,
  	 though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used.</br> The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a tube socket. </br>Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap.<br>
  	 The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input.<br> The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance, improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base.<br> There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.<br>

The earliest vacuum tubes evolved from incandescent <em>light bulbs</em>, containing a filament sealed in an evacuated glass envelope.<br>
When hot, the filament releases electrons into the vacuum, a process called thermionic emission, originally known as the Edison effect. 
A second electrode, the anode or plate, will attract those electrons if it is at a more positive voltage.<br> The result is a net flow of electrons from the filament to plate. However, electrons cannot flow in the reverse direction because the plate is not heated and does not emit electrons.<br>
The filament (cathode) has a dual function: it emits electrons when heated; and, together with the plate, it creates an electric field due to the potential difference between them.<br> Such a tube with only two electrodes is termed a diode, and is used for rectification.<br>
Since current can only pass in one direction, such a diode (or rectifier) will convert alternating current (AC) to pulsating DC.<br> Diodes can therefore be used in a DC power supply, as a demodulator of amplitude modulated (AM) radio signals and for similar functions.<br>

Early tubes used the filament as the cathode; this is called a "directly heated" tube. 
Most modern tubes are "indirectly heated" by a "heater" element inside a metal tube that is the cathode.<br> The heater is electrically isolated from the surrounding cathode and simply serves to heat the cathode sufficiently for thermionic emission of electrons.<br>
The electrical isolation allows all the tubes' heaters to be supplied from a common circuit (which can be AC without inducing hum) while allowing the cathodes in different tubes to operate at different voltages. H. J. Round invented the indirectly heated tube around 1913.<br>

The filaments require constant and often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level.<br> Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur even in an idle amplifier due to the quiescent current necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by radiation through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water-jacket.<br>

Klystrons and magnetrons often operate their anodes (called collectors in klystrons) at ground potential to facilitate cooling, particularly with water, without high-voltage insulation. These tubes instead operate with high negative voltages on the filament and cathode.<br>

Except for diodes, additional electrodes are positioned between the cathode and the plate (anode). 
These electrodes are referred to as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass on their way to the plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a triode, tetrode, pentode, etc., depending on the number of grids.<br> 
A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the control grid, (and sometimes other grids) transforms the diode into a voltage-controlled device: the voltage applied to the control grid affects the current between the cathode and the plate.<br>
When held negative with respect to the cathode, the control grid creates an electric field that repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode.<br> As long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the control grid is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts (depending on the circuit).<br>
The solid-state device which operates most like the pentode tube is the junction field-effect transistor (JFET), although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.

 <h1>Evolution Of Sensors</h1>

 </fieldset>
<frameset>
  <p id="p3">	Sensors have come a long way since the early days of first-generation devices such as MEMS sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and biosensors. The evolution of sensors led to the emergence of smart objects that are an integral part of the IoT.<br>
  	
  	Smart IoT sensors are one of the most widely adopted technologies that have a direct impact on supply chains, as they provide feedback on a physical process or product in a predictable, consistent, and measurable way. Clearly, the need for analytics and predictive data is driving the use of sensor technology and usage. Fortunately, recent advancements in sensor technologies have increased performance and reduced production costs, eliminating barriers to smart sensor adoption.
   Analytical tools have also improved, making it easier to extract insights from IoT data.<br>

Integrating IoT sensor technology into your supply chain increases the automated collection and processing of data, and helps you understand the real-time and future state of your complex, interdependent supply chains, which can in turn help improve performance, reliability, innovation, and demand planning.</p>

  	<h1>ARM</h1>
  </fieldset>
  <h3 style="margin-left:10%"> What is an Arm processor?</h3><br>
  	<p id="p4"> 
An Arm processor is one of a family of central processing units (CPUs) based on the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture for computer processors. Arm Limited, the company behind the Arm processor, designs the core CPU components and licenses the intellectual property to partner organizations, which then build Arm-based chips according to their own requirements. Arm Limited does not manufacture or sell any chips directly.<br>

Acorn Computers first developed the Arm processor in the 1980s. Until recently, the name Arm was treated as an acronym, ARM, which at first stood for Acorn RISC Machine and then for Advanced RISC Machine. The acronym is still widely used, although Arm Limited uses only Arm when describing its processor technology.<br>

Arm Limited offers designs for both 32-bit and 64-bit RISC multicore processors.
The processors use a much simpler instruction set than their Intel counterparts, which are based on the complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture. The two types of processors also employ different methods to optimize performance and increase efficiency. For example, Intel takes a hardware approach to maximizing performance, whereas Arm takes a software approach.<br>

<h3 style="margin-left:10%">The role of Arm Ltd.</h3><br>
<p style="margin-left:5%">
Arm processors can execute many more millions of instructions per second than Intel processors. By stripping out unneeded instructions and optimizing pathways, an Arm processor can deliver outstanding performance while using much less energy than a CISC-based processor.
The reduction in power also means that Arm CPUs generate less heat. That's not to say Arm processors are inherently better than Intel processors, only that they're better suited to specific use cases.

Arm processors are used extensively in consumer electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, wearables and other mobile devices.<br> They're also used in a wide range of sensors and internet of things devices. According to Arm Limited, the company's partners have shipped more than 215 billion Arm-based chips over the past three decades.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-left:10%">What are Arm processor features?</h3><br>
<p style="margin-left:5%">
Because of their reduced instruction set, Arm processors require fewer transistors, resulting in a smaller die size for the integrated circuitry. Their smaller size, reduced complexity and lower power consumption make them suitable for increasingly miniaturized devices.<br>
</p>
<h4 style="margin-left:10%">Arm processor features include the following:</h4><br>
<ul style="margin-left:15%">
<li>load/store architecture</li>
<li>integrated security</li>
<li>orthogonal instruction set</li>
<li>single-cycle execution</li>
<li>energy efficiency</li>
<li>64- and 32-bit execution states hardware virtualization support</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:5%">
The simplified design of Arm processors offers more efficient multicore processing and easier coding for developers.<br> While they don't offer the same raw compute throughput as Intel CPUs, Arm processors sometimes exceed the performance of Intel processors for applications that exist on both architectures.</p>
